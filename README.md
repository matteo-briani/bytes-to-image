# bytes to image

This is a very simple and brutal script to render files of small sizes to `png` images.
I wrote to use it in [this article](https://matteo-briani.github.io/personal-website/inside-these-little-fellas-called-files-the-ELF/) while I was playing with the ELF files.

Usage
```
pipenv run python convert-bytes-to-image.py --input <INPUT FILE> --output <OUTPUT FILE>
```
